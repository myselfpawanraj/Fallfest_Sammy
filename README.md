# Sammy, an advanced video player

### About

Sammy is a multimedia player that can help you find, in a video, anything from a simple phrase that was spoken to a scene that you can describe in words.
We combined OCR (Optical Character Recognition), ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and Scene Understanding (SDD) to describe the scene taking place in the video and to make this information searchable.

### Features

- Specially-enabled people are able to understand and navigate through video content.
- Nobody has to spend ages searching for a single line in hour-long videos.
